# TICTACTOE
This is just a simple TCP/IP tic-tac-toe game. It has a lot of bugs and the code is horrible but I want to have it here just for my own nostalgic feelings. So please don't judge me :D  

# UPDATES
~version 0.1~ - I added ip textbox, so you can connect anywhere on LAN
~version 0.1.1~ - Added tied option
